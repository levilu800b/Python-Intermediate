# Instructions
# ðŸ’ª This exercise is HARD
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
#
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
#
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
#
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
# IMPORTANT: The output should be a list of integers and not strings! Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
# Hint
# Use the keyword method for starting the List comprehension and fill in the relevant parts.
#
# First, you will need to read from the files and create a list using the lines in the files.
#
# This method will be really useful: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_file_readlines.asp
#
# Remember you can check if a value exists in a list using the in keyword.

#
# Remember you can use the int() method in python to convert a string into an integer.

with open('file1.txt') as file1:
    file1_list = file1.readlines()
    # file1_list = [int(num.strip('\n')) for num in file1_list]

with open('file2.txt') as file2:
    file2_list = file2.readlines()
    # file2_list = [int(num.strip('\n')) for num in file2_list]

# result = [num for num in file1_list if num in file2_list]
# result = [int(num.strip('\n')) for num in file1_list if num in file2_list]
result = [int(num) for num in file1_list if num in file2_list]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†
print(result)
